##New BI Solution: IMS Help Tickets
######Scenario
At my work, a team of trained volunteers serve as superusers for our audit management application called IMS. Any IMS user with an issue or question may submit a help ticket by phone or online to request assistance from an IMS superuser. Unless the user asks for a specific superuser, the help desk coordinator will make the superuser assignment based on geographic location. The assigned superuser will troubleshoot the user's issue and attempt to resolve it. If the superuser cannot resolve the issue due to lack of expertise or insufficient permissions on the system, he or she will contact the help desk coordinator to request elevation of the issue to an IMS expert. As soon as the issue is resolved by either the superuser or the expert, the superuser reports back to the help desk coordinator about details of the issue and resolution of the ticket. Records of IMS help ticket transactions are kept in an electronic database system.
######Proposed new solution
There is not currently a formal reporting system in place for IMS help tickets. The client (help desk management) would like a BI solution that provides them with accurate information about IMS help ticket transactions.
